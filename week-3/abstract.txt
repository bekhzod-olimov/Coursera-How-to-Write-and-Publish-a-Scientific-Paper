Recently, the introduction of Convolutional Neural Network (CNNs) have advanced the way of solving image segmentation tasks. 
Biomedical image segmentation has considerably benefited from employing various CNN models. The most widely used network 
in this field is U-Net and its different variations. Although U-Net has achieved the state-of-the-art performance, we consider that 
it can be further improved. Therefore, in the present paper, we aim to modify its particular aspects to improve its performance 
through developing a fast U-Net (FU-Net) relying on bottleneck convolution layers in the contraction and expansion paths of the 
model. The amount of memory required by the proposed model is reduced by 23 times when compared with the original U-Net. 
Moreover, the modifications allowed achieving better performance. In conducted experiments, we assessed the performance of 
the proposed model on two biomedical image segmentation datasets, namely 2018 Data Science Bowl and ICIS 2018: Skin Lesion 
Analysis Towards Melanoma Detection. FU-Net demonstrated the state-of-the-art results in biomedical image segmentation, requiring
 the number of trainable parameters reduced by eight times compared with the original U-Net model. In addition, using bottleneck 
layers decreased the number of computations, resulting in nearly 30% speed-up at the training, validation and test stages. 
Furthermore, despite relying on fewer parameters FU-Net achieved a slight improvement of the performance in terms of pixel accuracy, 
Jaccard index, and dice coefficient evaluation metrics.
